/* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by 
adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose 
values do not exceed four million,
 find the sum of the even-valued terms.
